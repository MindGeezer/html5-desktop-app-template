# Html5 Desktop Application Template
A starter kit template for building desktop like applications using web technologies.

## Why
I wanted an application template that mimics the toolbar, status bar, side panel, scalable content page that standard desktop applications utilize.

It was modeled after the Visual Studio Code UI.

## Versions
- Html (master branch)
- React (react branch)

## Browser support

This template has been tested in:
- Internet Explorer 11
- Microsoft Edge
- Chrome
- Firefox

## Features
 - Uses less for css
 - Gulp build system
 - Uses flexbox for layouts
 - Sticky headers & footers
 	- Always visible and won't scroll out of view no matter how much content is added to other panes.
 - Main content page scrollbars
